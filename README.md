# Barnacles List Scraper
Author: Steven Daniel Vaughan (daniel@vaughan.codes)

This program is used to retrieve a new-line separated list of URLs from a user-defined URL, then scrapes each URL for keywords of the user's choice.

This can be especially useful for:
  - Tracking important topics from URL feeds
  - Retrieving data remotely using a self-hosted feed of URLs
  - Detecting phishing attacks
  
    ...and much more!
    
TODO:
  - Keyword searching functionality
  - Multi-threading
